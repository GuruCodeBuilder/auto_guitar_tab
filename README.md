# auto_guitar_tab
Convert wav files of electric guitar recordings into tablature that can be read.

This project will make use of fast fourier transforms (FFT), machine learning, and web development to create an application for guitarists.

The input would be a .wav file inputted by the use. There are few requirements for this .wav file. The listed requirements thus far include:
    - the file is .wav
    - the .wav file must be audio from the guitar directly inputted into a computer audio proccessing system.
    - this implies the guitar being used is electric or can in some way directly transfer sound wav files to the computer
    - The guitar is a standard 6 string guitar

The output will be a displayed tablature in the GUI.
